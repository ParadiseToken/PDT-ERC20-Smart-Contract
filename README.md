## What problems do Paradise Token attempt to solve?

“Paradise” embraces blockchain technology to open a decentralized direct booking in
the travel and tourism sector. Peer‐to‐peer economy applications, typified by
Expedia, Tripadviser, Booking.com, and Priceline have achieved great success
in the past few years. However, these platforms charge high commission fees,
advertising fees and also payment processing fees from their users in order to
run. Huge growth is only enjoyed by a select few VCs and the founders. No
interest in the company, very little, if any, of the appreciation value goes back
to the guests and hosts. Thanks to Ethereum smart contracts, it is now
possible to build a truly decentralized and automated sharing economy
platform. This will be done with no middlemen, 0% fees for advertising, 0%
commission fees and by sharing the wealth with the users in a two‐sided
marketplace. The Paradise vast connection with the biggest hotel chains in the
world will be only huge benefit to users.
